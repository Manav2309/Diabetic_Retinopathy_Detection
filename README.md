*Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Transfer Learning and SMOTE*

Overview
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images using transfer learning and SMOTE. The goal is to classify retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy, addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets with SMOTE.

Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models like ResNet50 and InceptionV3.
SMOTE: Handles imbalanced datasets by oversampling underrepresented classes.
Data Augmentation: Enhances model robustness.
Metrics: Evaluates performance with F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
